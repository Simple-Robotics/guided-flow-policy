## Guided flow policy
GFP is a flow matching based offline RL methods. It couples a multi-step flow-matching policy trained with value-aware behavior cloning and a distilled one-step actor through a bidirectional guidance mechanism. 
This synergy enables GFP to achieve state-of-the-art performance across 144 state and pixel-based tasks from the OGBench, Minari, and D4RL benchmarks, with substantial gains on suboptimal datasets and challenging tasks.
